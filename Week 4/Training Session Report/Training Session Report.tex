\section{Conclusion}
The mock training session provided valuable insights into the effectiveness of the Tulip OEE Application training materials. Participants were generally satisfied with the clarity and comprehensiveness of the resources, but identified specific areas for improvement, particularly in troubleshooting guidance and visual aids. These insights have been incorporated into the final training resource package, resulting in more accessible and comprehensive training materials.

The enhanced training package now includes additional video tutorials, expanded written documentation with more visual aids, and a more robust troubleshooting guide. These improvements will ensure that Moto IE engineers can effectively utilize and maintain the customized Tulip OEE application, leading to improved operational efficiency and data-driven decision-making.
